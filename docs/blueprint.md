## Style Guidelines:

- The color palette should be based on cyan, reflecting technology and innovation, and the fact that the app facilitates connections between different campus factions. The color scheme will use a dark background. Primary color: Cyan (#00FFFF)
- Background color: Very dark cyan (#033030). This provides the 'dark mode' appearance specified by the user, which also complements the glowing text.
- Accent color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF). This vibrant shade, analogous to cyan, will guide the user to the essential areas of the interface.
- Font choice: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text. This pairing balances modern aesthetics with readability for longer content.
- Use glowing, minimalist icons that correspond to interactive and animated 3D design elements. This includes a spinning tetrahedron as a loading icon.
- Mobile-first, responsive design with fluid transitions. A grid-based layout will organize content efficiently across devices.
- Complex 3D and interactive animations with anime.js, scroll-triggered effects on landing page, animated loading screens and interactive background elements.
